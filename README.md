# Punxsutawney Phil Live 🦫

Fake livestream of a talking groundhog. [groundhog.live](https://groundhog.live)

## Systems

- **Chaos/Order** – Phil drifts between Winter (paranoid, bitter) and Spring (manic, aggressive) based on chat
- **16 Chatter Archetypes** – fanboy, troll, hater, boomer, unhinged, conspiracy, gen_alpha, drunk, etc.
- **Rant System** – Autonomous current events rants with spiciness scaling
- **Reactive Chatters** – Chatters pile on when Phil rants
- **Priority Cooldowns** – Fast responses to users, slow for dead air

## Stack

- Next.js 14 / React Three Fiber / Tailwind
- Gemini 2.0 Flash with search grounding (Phil + chatters)
- ElevenLabs for voice

*Phil's prediction accuracy is "debated."*
